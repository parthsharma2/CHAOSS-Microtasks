- [X] **Microtask 0:** Familiarize yourself with augur by downloading and configuring the dev branch. For a little more context about what we are trying to accomplish with Augur's prototyping, checkout the blog posts on the Augur Website. The community manager use case is especially interesting.
- [X] **Microtask 1:** Using the Augur reference database included in the setup, configure a new metric from those available an not implemented in the "Metrics Status" page.
